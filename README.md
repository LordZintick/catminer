### What is Catminer?
  Catminer is a clicker game where you would click a cat to mine a rock
  <br>
  You would buy upgrades that would help increase the amount of catcoins you aquired until you reached enough to buy the **ULTIMATE WONDER**, which completed the game.
  <br>
  It was a pretty simple game, and Catminer 2 builds upon that simplicity to make it more interesting and fun.
##  ![catminer2-cat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c899ea3-385a-4b00-b607-323e58550f98) Overview
  Catminer 2 - New Adventures revamps the previous version of the game with new upgrades, new features, new currencies, and more
  <br>
  You can still click on the cat and buy upgrades, but now there are **Rebirths**
  <br>
  ### ![catminer2-rebirth](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/058218bd-2f47-4276-aced-67e7b2d63dd1) Rebirthing
  Rebirthing costs a certain amount of catcoins, gems, crystals, and diamonds, and it resets most things, but it gives you cat treats which can be spent on powerful multiplier upgrades
  <br>
  Rebirthing also unlocks new features and upgrades, including a laboratory, a pickaxe upgrade area, and upgrades that give you currency per second
  ## Currencies
  There are currently **six** currencies you can aquire through gameplay:
  ### ![catminer2-coin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1005d15c-4440-44b9-834a-b6dd92a71b49) Catcoins
  The main currency of the game, catcoins are easily aquired and used to buy a multitude of things, such as the gem chance upgrade and cps (catcoins per second) upgrades
  > [!NOTE]
  > Catcoins are not aquired by a chance, you get a certain amount of them per click/second
  
  ### ![catminer2-gem](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d659555c-3571-42ab-90e3-68df2a1f873c) Gems
  Gems are the second most common, only requiring 2 rebirths to unlock their chance upgrade.
  <br>
  Gems can be spent on a more powerful pickaxe upgrade, or a crystal chance upgrade
  ### ![catminer2-crystal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/538dabc9-d0ad-4d5c-ad19-981808c4633e) Crystals
  Crystals are the next rarest currency, and their chance upgrade is unlocked at 4 rebirths
  <br>
  Crystals can be spent on an even more powerful pickaxe upgrade, a diamond chance upgrade, or a gems per second upgrade
  ### ![catminer2-diamond](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa402d30-14d3-49aa-970e-84fdedfc7bfd) Diamonds
  Diamonds are most special and rarest currency, requiring 6 rebirths and some crystals to unlock their chance upgrade
  > [!NOTE]
  > Diamonds can only be aquired and their chance is only applied when you get a crystal, so make sure your crystal chance is pretty high!
  
  Diamonds can be spent on the most powerful pickaxe upgrade or a crystals per second upgrade
  ### ![catminer2-cat_treats](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92989154-9f71-438b-9795-5b7359017dcb) Cat Treats
  Cat treats are a precious resource aquired upon rebirthing and can be spent on multiplier upgrades for catcoins, gems, crystals, or diamonds
  > [!TIP]
  > The amount of cat treats you earn upon rebirthing can be increased using research!

  ### ![catminer2-research](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93ffc567-325f-42ee-aa7e-938673d6d6b5) Research
  Research is aquired by sacrificing some catcoins, gems, or crystals to commit research and gain research
  <br>
  Research can be spent on powerful, permanent upgrades such as increasing the cat treats you get on rebirth
  > [!TIP]
  > The best research upgrade is the "Hold-to-Click" upgrade, because it allows you to hold down on the cat to mine!
  > <br>
  > Make sure to buy that upgrade as soon as possible, because it makes the rest of the game much, much easier!

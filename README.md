# Catminer 2 - New Adventures!
Catminer 2 is a remake of a previous game I made called Catminer
<br>
**I made catminer 2 using the [_Construct Game Engine_](construct.net), you should check them out**
<br>
_(You can find that game [here](tinyurl.com/catminer))_
### What is Catminer?
  Catminer is a clicker game where you click a cat to mine a rock
  <br>
  Very simple, I know.
  <br>
  You would buy upgrades that would help increase the amount of catcoins you aquired until you reached enough to buy the **ULTIMATE WONDER**, which completed the game
<br>
## Overview
  Catminer 2 - New Adventures revamps the previous version of the game with new upgrades, new features, new currencies, and more
  <br>
  You can still click on the cat and buy upgrades, but now there are **Rebirths**
  <br>
  ### Rebirthing
  Rebirthing costs a certain amount of catcoins, gems, crystals, and diamonds, but it gives you cat treats which can be spent on powerful multiplier upgrades
  <br>
  Rebirthing also unlocks new features and upgrades, including a laboratory, a pickaxe upgrade area, and upgrades that givs you currency per second
  ## Currencies
  There are currently four currencies that you can get from mining the rock:
  ### Catcoins
  The main currency of the game, catcoins are easily aquired and used to buy a multitude of things, such as the gem chance upgrade and cps (catcoins per second) upgrades
  ### Gems
  Gems are the second most common, only requiring 2 rebirths to unlock their driller.
  <br>
  Gems can be spent on a more powerful pickaxe upgrade, or a crystal chance upgrade
  ### Crystals
  Crystals are the next rarest currency, and their chance upgrade is unlocked at 4 rebirths
  <br>
  Crystals can be spent on an even more powerful pickaxe upgrade, a diamond chance upgrade, or a gems per second upgrade
  ### Diamonds
  Diamonds are most special and rarest currency, requiring 6 rebirths and some crystals to unlock their driller
  <br>
  Diamonds can only be gotten as a chance when you get a crystal, so they are even rarer
  <br>
  Diamonds can be spent on the most powerful pickaxe upgrade or a crystals per second upgrade
